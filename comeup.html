				<h2>the comeup</h2>
				<p>
					Temmler's new wonder-drug could keep truckers driving, students studying, and factory workers assembling. It reduced appetite and created energy. All sorts of ailments, from drowsiness to depression, seasickness to schizophrenia, were treated with the red, white, and blue of a Pervitin tube. It was cheaper and stronger than coffee, something that most Germans struggled to get since the start of World War II. Methamphetamine was the new craze sweeping across the nation.

					The biggest customers were not just civilians, but the Reich itself. Dr. Otto F. Ranke, the director of Research Institute of Defense Physiology, declared that the greatest enemy the army faced were not the Russians, French, nor British, but an internal actor: exhaustion. A sleeping soldier cannot march forward, drive tanks, or shoot enemies. For that reason, Pervitin's ability to keep people up anywhere from 36 to 50 hours without exhaustion was a miracle for the military. Men were armed with not just rifles, but Pervitin, making them stronger than the roadblocks and enemies they encountered on the battlefield.

				Germany was more productive and energetic than ever before. The Wehrmacht was unstoppable. <i>What could go wrong?</i>
