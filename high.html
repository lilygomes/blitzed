					Director Ranke had started to realise the dangers of Pervitin: at his Military Medical Academy in Munich, students were overdosing so often that a room had to be set aside for these "Pervitin corpses"&mdash;students who went out cold and needed to rest before they came back. The exam results of students who had admitted to using methamphetamine were very poor in comparison to their sober classmates. Worried, he had cancelled another Pervitin experiment scheduled for 1939, but it was too late; the Wehrmacht was already on its way to invade Poland with Pervitin in their pockets.

					On the 1st of September, 1939, a great storm took place. Not only were the Nazis storming Poland, crossing rivers and crushing Polish defenders on their way, but norepinephrine and dopamine were storming their brains all through the ordeal. With little direction, or even a proper dosage outlined, the army gulped down the sugar-coated pep pills. By consuming methamphetamine, war became a task to be completed&mdash;even if that task meant killing. It switched off inhibitions and doubled energy, powering Nazi soldiers through night marches and tank drives. During their advance through the River Vistula, the 3rd Panzer Division reported back:

					<i>Everyone fresh and cheerful, excellent discipline. Slight euphoria and increased thirst for action. Mental encouragement, very stimulated. No accidents. Long-lasting effect. After taking four tablets, double vision and seeing colours. The feeling of hunger subsides. One particularly beneficial aspect is the appearance of a vigorous urge to work. The effect is so clear that it cannot be based on imagination.</i>

					The invasion of Poland proved a great success for Pervitin. Stimulants would revolutionise warfare, Nazi commanders realised. On the western front, Germany was going to storm through Belgium and into France. Powered by Pervitin, they charged head-on into the entrenched and fortified Belgians with maddening speed, shocking the Belgian defenders into retreat. After three days of nonstop fighting, the German forces had already reached the French border. Despite having powered through a suicide mission with no sleep, Nazi soldiers kept going. Dive bombers and artillery gave the infantry cover as they trudged on into French territory. By the time French military reinforcements arrived, the Germans had already crossed the Meuse River. 60,000 German soldiers, 22,000 vehicles, and 850 tanks had crossed the border, to the shock of the French. They were no match for the insane speed of the methamphetamine-fueled Wehrmacht.
