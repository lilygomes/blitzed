					This site is based on the novel <i>Blitzed: Drugs in Nazi Germany</i> by Norman Ohler. His novel details, in depth, how the drug use pervaded Nazi society from the masses to Adolf Hitler himself. Ohler does a great job of explaining the progression from post-WWI Germany's drug addiction, to Nazi tee-totalism, and back to mass addiction. His descriptive and comprehensive wrting gives additional perspective to how drugs enabled&mdash;even influenced&mdash;world history from the actions of Nazi Germany.
					Ohler's book is a great read, using the timeline of events to create tension and intrigue. This website is for a project on the themes of the book. Each section puts the events of history into the perspective of a drug user: getting the drugs, taking them, and suffering the consequences of drug use. The pattern is derived from the metaphor-driven comparisons seen in <i>Blitzed</i> itself, which draws many comparisons between the physiological effects of drugs and the events that occurred in history which were fueled by them.
