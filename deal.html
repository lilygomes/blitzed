				<h2>the deal</h2>
				<p>
					Money was worthless. Two million, eight hundred thousand men had died, and another four million men were wounded. Unemployment hit all-time highs. After World War I, Germany was devastated. Prospects were bleak, and life even bleaker. Surrounded by hopelessness and suffering, many Germans turned to vice. Berlin became the international capital of sex and drugs; the latter of which were one of the nation's biggest exports. Bayer Heroin and Merck cocaine were known worldwide for their purity and potency. An era of chemical hedonism ensued, patching over the nation's sorrows.

					When the Nazis campaigned for power, they targeted one of Germany's biggest issues: drug addiction. The Nazis knew that Germany was suffering from widespread addiction, and claimed that they would lift Germany out of the plague. They linked drugs to their favourite scapegoat: the jews. They claimed that the habit-forming chemicals were a tool used by the Jewish elite to enslave the German people. When Hitler came to absolute power, he brought the hammer down, tightening up drug laws to draconian extremes and cutting off prescriptions with little warning.

					At the Berlin Olympics of 1936, one drug made a big impact: amphetamine. The American company Smith, Kline &amp; French trademarked it by the name Benzedrine. The CNS stimulant gave athletes more energy and power, and was still a legal doping agent at the time. The German pharmaceutical company Temmler saw an opportunity: could they make a domestic competitor? They focused in on a new drug from Japan: methamphetamine. Temmler figured out how to synthesise methamphetamine from an industrial waste product, and pushed full steam ahead. Germany had a new drug that left Benzedrine in the dust, and they named it <i>Pervitin.</i>
